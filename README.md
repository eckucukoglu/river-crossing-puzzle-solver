# About river crossing puzzle
Suppose that there is a group of 8 people consisting of a mother (M), a father (F), two daughters (A, B), two sons (C, D), a policeman (P) and a thief (T) that would all like to cross to the right side of a river using a single raft (R). The original puzzle assumes that all people are initially on the left side of the river, but solver can solve any given initial configuration. The raft can carry at most 2 people at a time and only the mother, the father and the policeman know how to operate the raft. The father has trouble handling the daughters if the mother is not present, and similarly the mother cannot pacify the sons properly in the absence of the father. It is also dangerous for any family member to be around the thief if the policeman is not keeping a close eye on.
